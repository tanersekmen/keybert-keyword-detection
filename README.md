This project is developed for extracting and detecting keywords from Turkish texts using the KeyBERT framework.

## Project Description

The project aims to perform keyword extraction and detection in Turkish texts using the open-source Python library, [KeyBERT](https://github.com/MaartenGr/KeyBERT). KeyBERT utilizes a BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) based model to identify important words in texts.

## Features

- Extraction of keywords from Turkish texts
- Detection of significant words in a given text
- Customization options for various parameters provided by KeyBERT

## How to Use
